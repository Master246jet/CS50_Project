# CS50_Project
Final Project for CS50x

Mobile Application using Ionic or React Native.
    I don't want to use Swift, as it is only intended for IOS.
    I want to create a cross-mobile application.

React Native - More modern, more recommended but requires time to learn React.

Ionic - I know all the pre requisites, I just have to get used to Ionic. (Less Time)

Deadline: 31/12/2023
My Term Ends at: 6-16/1/2024
Prioritize Time -> Ionic.

Concept:
I want to create an app that helps me keep myself in check.
Features:
1. Habit Tracking
2. Salat Consistency
3. Getting rid of bad habits
4. Journalling (daily, how did this go...)
