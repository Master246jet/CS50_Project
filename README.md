# CS50_Project
Final Project for CS50x

Mobile Application using Ionic or React Native.
    I don't want to use Swift, as it is only intended for IOS.
    I want to create a cross-mobile application.

Flutter is best choice for multi-platform
However to upload an IOS app you need to create a virtual workspace in the form of macOS, to use Xcode to then publish as an IOS app. This is for all IOS apps.

Deadline: 31/12/2023
My Term Ends at: 6-16/1/2024

I want to create an app that helps me keep myself in check.
